# What is DOM in JavaScript ?

Document Object Model-(DOM)

*DOM - "Document Object Model". It's a standardized way of representing the structure of a document
(such as HTML) as a tree-like structure, where each node represents a part of the document, such as an
element, attribute, text content, etc. DOM allows programs and scripts to access, manipulate, and
update the content, structure, and styles of a web page. JavaScript is commonly used to interact with
the DOM in web development, for tasks such as dynamically changing the content of a page or handling
user events.*
